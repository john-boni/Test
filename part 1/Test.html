            People in China eat unusual animals. For example, these animals are pangolins or bats. Scientists think that it can be a problem. Scientists believe that these animals can spread the coronavirus.

            China makes a new list of animals that people can eat. People can eat pigs, cows, chickens, and sheep. Pangolins and bats are not on the list.
            
            Also, dogs are not on the list. Dogs are on the list of pets. This is a happy moment for some people. Some people protect animals. They believe that animals need better care.
            
            The Chinese government must agree with the list. It can be a happy moment for people who like animals. People in China eat more than 10 million dogs every year. However, they also keep more than 90 million dogs and cats as pets.
            
            Difficult words: pangolin (an animal that lives in Africa and Asia that eats small insects), list (a document with many things or names), protect (to keep safe).
